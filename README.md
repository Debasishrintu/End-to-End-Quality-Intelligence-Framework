A production-grade Quality Engineering platform that elevates test automation into **release-level quality intelligence**, enabling data-driven Go/No-Go decisions through CI/CD pipelines, critical test analysis, and centralized Allure dashboards.

---

## Executive Summary

The **End-to-End Quality Intelligence Framework** represents a QE 1.0 maturity model, where automation is no longer limited to test execution but becomes an **integral input to release decisions**.

This framework was evolved from a full-stack automation system into a **decision-oriented quality platform**, reflecting how modern product organizations implement Quality Engineering at scale.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional automation frameworks answer only one question:

> Did the tests pass?

In real-world engineering organizations, the real question is:

> **Is this build safe to release to customers?**

This framework is designed to bridge that gap.

---

## Key Outcomes

The framework provides:

* Fast confidence through Smoke testing
* Risk visibility through Regression coverage
* Business impact awareness via Critical test analysis
* CI/CD-driven release readiness reporting
* Centralized, shareable quality dashboards

---

## 📊 Live Quality Dashboard (Allure)

🔗 **Allure Dashboard (GitHub Pages)**
[https://debasish-87.github.io/End-to-End-Quality-Intelligence-Framework/](https://debasish-87.github.io/End-to-End-Quality-Intelligence-Framework/)

The dashboard is automatically generated and published after every pipeline execution, providing centralized visibility for QA, engineering, and leadership stakeholders.

---

## What Makes This a Quality Intelligence Framework

Unlike conventional automation frameworks, this system introduces **context and intent** into test results.

It provides:

* Suite-level confidence (Smoke vs Regression)
* Severity- and criticality-aware failure analysis
* Release-oriented quality summaries
* Historical execution readiness via Allure trends

This mirrors the quality visibility model used in mature product teams.

## Core Capabilities

### Automation Coverage

| Layer               | Technology         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| UI Automation       | Selenium WebDriver |
| API Automation      | RestAssured        |
| Database Validation | MySQL              |
| Test Orchestration  | TestNG             |
| Language            | Java 17            |

---

### Suite-Based Quality Strategy

| Suite      | Purpose                           | Typical Usage         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Smoke      | Validates critical business flows | Pull requests         |
| Regression | Ensures full functional stability | Nightly / pre-release |
| Critical   | Blocks release on business risk   | Release gating        |

Suite execution is controlled using:

* `smoke.xml`
* `regression.xml`
* TestNG groups (`Smoke`, `Regression`, `Critical`)

---

## Quality Metrics Engine

The framework computes and exposes actionable metrics such as:

* Total tests executed
* Pass and fail percentages
* Critical test failures
* Suite-level execution confidence
* Trend readiness via Allure history

These metrics enable **objective quality discussions**, replacing subjective release judgments.

---

## Release Decision Engine

Execution data is consolidated into **decision-oriented summaries**, for example:

```
SMOKE SUITE     : PASS
REGRESSION     : 95%
CRITICAL FAILS : 1

FINAL DECISION : HOLD RELEASE
```

This reflects how release readiness is evaluated in real engineering review meetings.

## Test Execution

Run complete test suite:

```bash
mvn clean test
```

Run Smoke suite:

```bash
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=smoke.xml"
```

Run Regression suite:

```bash
mvn clean test "-DsuiteXmlFile=regression.xml"
```

Headless execution for CI:

```bash
mvn clean test -Dheadless=true
```

---

## Reporting

Local report generation:

```bash
mvn allure:serve
```

CI/CD reporting:

* Reports generated automatically after execution
* Deployed to GitHub Pages
* Centralized and versioned visibility

---

## CI/CD Integration

The GitHub Actions pipeline performs:

* Test execution on every push
* Allure report generation
* Automated deployment to GitHub Pages

Workflow configuration:

```
.github/workflows/allure-deploy.yml
```

## How to Explain This Project in an Interview

> “I designed a Quality Intelligence Framework that integrates UI, API, and database automation with CI/CD pipelines. It transforms raw test execution into release-level quality insights by analyzing critical test failures and providing Go/No-Go visibility through centralized dashboards.”

This demonstrates **Quality Engineering ownership**, not just automation implementation.
